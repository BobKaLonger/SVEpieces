Adds a 4th upgrade after the Mega Coop and Barn (added by jenf1) upping animal capacity to 40.

Is mega still not enough? Do you want to have a silly amount of animals in one building? Well, for some reason, I did, so I made this mod.

Gigantic Coops and Barns will hold up to 40 animals each, with TWO rows of hay and plenty of room for some machines. I made the maps extremely clean (no hay piles or junk) with a regular floor and lighting pattern because of my personal preference. The water sources ARE water sources, and the Giga Coop will come with another extra incubator, movable (spawns in a new spot so as not to crash with the default placement of the Mega Coop's extra incubator).

The building footprints and exterior appearance stay the same as the vanilla Deluxe Coop and Barn (just like the Mega Coop and Barn) so any recolors or reskins should carry over. These buildings won't take up any more space but you're going to need more silos....or just a Bigger Silo Size.

Giga Barn cost:
150000g
900 wood
700 stone
300 hardwood

Giga Coop cost
120000g
800 wood
600 stone
200 hardwood

You absolutely MUST have jenf1's Mega Coop and Barn mod because this upgrade only upgrades the Mega Coop or Barn.
